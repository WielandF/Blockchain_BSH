# Blockchain_BSH


This is a project to find out what use the blockchain technology can have for the german Bausparkassen sector.
Therefore we are using MultiChain (https://www.multichain.com/) as Blockchain.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to show possible application areas of blockchain technology by simulating the exemption process ("Freistellungsprozess").
In order to achieve this, an autonomous peer-peer network was established to be able to represent a customer interaction. 
The blockchain runs on an ubuntu distribution, while the frontend uses windows 7.

# Why Blockchain?
The advantages of the Blockchain technology are manifold. For example, anything you want to transmit can be transmitted securely and confidentially without the risk of unlawful modification. In addition, transactions can be verified via an extensive peer-peer network (decentralisation). These two points help to reduce the risk of fraud and make transactions faster and safer.
