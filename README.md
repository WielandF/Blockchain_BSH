# Blockchain_BSH


This is a project to find out what use the blockchain technology can have for the german Bausparkassen sector.
Therefore we are using Multichain (https://www.multichain.com/) as Blockchain.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to show possible application areas of blockchain technology by simulating the exemption process ("Freistellungsprozess").
In order to achieve this, an autonomous peer-peer network was established to be able to represent a customer interaction. 
The blockchain runs on an ubuntu distribution, while the frontend uses windows 7.
